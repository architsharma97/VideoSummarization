Dataset:  ydata-tvsum50-v1_1

===========================================================================
Yahoo! TVSum50 Title-based Video Summarization dataset, version 1.1

The TVSum50 dataset contains 50 videos and their shot-level subjective 
importance scores annotated via crowdsourcing. The videos are collected 
from YouTube in September 2014 and come with the Creative Commons (CC-BY)
license. The dataset shall be used to evaluate automatic video
summarization techniques.

Full description:

This dataset contains four zip-compressed archive files:

    (1) ydata-tvsum50-video.zip
    (2) ydata-tvsum50-thumbnail.zip
    (3) ydata-tvsum50-data.zip
    (4) ydata-tvsum50-matlab.zip

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first two zip archives contain 50 videos and their thumbnail images. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third (ydata-tvsum50-data.zip) contains two tsv-format data files:

    ./data/ydata-tvsum50-info.tsv
    ./data/ydata-tvsum50-anno.tsv

The content of the two files are as follows:

(a) "./data/ydata-tvsum50-info.tsv" contains metadata of the 50 videos,
    with the following fields:

        0 video category code (VT, VU, GA, MS, PK, PR, FM, BK, BT, DS)
        1 video id
        2 video title
        3 url
        4 length (MM:SS format) 

    The 50 videos are grouped by 10 categories (5 videos per category).
    The categories are identified by two-letter codes, whose names are: 

        VT: Changing Vehicle Tire
        VU: Getting Vehicle Unstuck
        GA: Grooming an Animal
        MS: Making Sandwich
        PK: Parkour
        PR: Parade
        FM: Flash Mob Gathering
        BK: Bee Keeping
        BT: Attempting Bike Tricks
        DS: Dog Show
	
(b) "./data/ydata-tvsum50-anno.tsv" contains shot importance annotations. 
    The file contains the following fields:

        0 video id
        1 video category code
        2 importance score, from 1 (low) to 5 (high)

    Each line represents an annotation of a video made by one crowd-worker.
    There are 1000 lines in the file (50 videos, 20 annotations per video).
    The third field contains shot-level importance scores (comma-separated).
    Each shot is always two-second long.
	

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fourth zip archive (ydata-tvsum50-matlab.zip) contains the dataset in 
MATLAB format as well as some scripts to evaluate your own summarization 
results. Upon uncompressing, you will see the following files/directories:
    
    ./matlab/ydata-tvsum50.mat
    ./matlab/[several matlab scripts]

(a) "./matlab/ydata-tvsum50.mat" is a MATLAB format data file. It contains 
    a single struct variable 'tvsum50' with the following fields

    video      video id
    category   two-letter video category code
    title      video title
    length     video duration (MM:SS format)
    nframes    number of frames
    user_anno  shot-level importance scores made by 20 human judges 
    gt_score   average shot-level importance score

(b) "./matmab/[several matlab scripts]â€œ contains MATLAB scripts describing 
   how you can evaluate your own summarization results.
